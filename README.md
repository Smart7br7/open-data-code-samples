# Open Data Code samples

This repository contains code samples for working with datasets from Beer-Sheva's open data portal.

The open data portal can be found here: https://www.beer-sheva.muni.il/OpenData/Pages/Data.aspx

The portal runs on an open-source data management system named [CKAN](https://ckan.org).

Information regarding CKAN's API can be found [here](https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.8/api/#action-api-reference).
